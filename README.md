# Web-scraping-challenge - Mission to Mars

In this assignment, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

## Step 1 - Scraping

* Scrape the [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that you can reference later.

### NASA Mars News
### JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image
### Mars Facts
### Mars Hemispheres

## Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application

Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

# Contents

1. The Jupyter Notebook containing the scraping code used.

2. Screenshots of your final application.

3. Submit the link to your new repository to BootCampSpot.

4. Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file
